## Section 3: User Interface (Adaptive Cards)
## The Use Case: 
Using an Adaptive Card for selecting an Operating System (Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux) is much better than a text prompt because of Data Validation. If we let a user type their OS, they might misspell it or give a vague answer like -The silver one. A card provides a button-based interface that prevents user error and ensures our system receives the exact data it needs to trigger the right workflow.
